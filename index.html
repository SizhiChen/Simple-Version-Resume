<!-- My Summary -->
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    Hi, my name is Sizhi Chen. Please call me Strong. I studied at the University of California,<br/>
    Irvine, with a Bachelor of Economics degree, and I graduated from UCI in 2021. After that,<br/>
    I went to China and found two jobs. At first, I had just worked for a small company called<br/>
    Hexin Investment. I was a research intern. Then, I went to a more prominent company called<br/>
    CreditEase and became a customer manager there. Finally, I discovered I still needed to<br/>
    learn more skills, so I applied for a Master's degree at Northeastern University in 2022,<br/>
    majoring in Analytics, and graduated in 2024. After that, I found more interest in Software<br/>
    Development, so I applied for another Master's degree at Northeastern University in 2024<br/>
    with a major in Computer Science. I am currently a Master of Computer Science student<br/>
    looking for co-op opportunities.
